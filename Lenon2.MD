# Lesson 2: Deep Dive into HTTP, Dependency Injection, and Inversion of Control

In this second installment of our ASP.NET Core Web API course, we will explore critical concepts that form the backbone of web development and the architectural principles that underpin robust application design in .NET 7/8. This lesson is structured to build upon the foundational knowledge from Lesson 1, focusing on HTTP mechanics, the ASP.NET Core request/response pipeline, and the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern.

## Topics Covered

- **Understanding HTTP Fundamentals**: Gain a deeper understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), including requests and responses, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), and status codes. This knowledge is crucial for developing and troubleshooting web APIs.

- **Request/Response Pipeline**: Explore how ASP.NET Core processes HTTP requests and generates responses. We'll cover the journey of an HTTP request through the ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline to the controller action and back to the client.

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Learn about the DI design pattern, its benefits in application development, and how it promotes cleaner, more modular code. We'll discuss how ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container helps manage dependencies across your project.

- **Inverted Dependency and Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Understand these two closely related principles that form the basis of the DI pattern. We'll explain how inversion of control shifts the responsibility of managing dependencies away from your classes, leading to more decoupled and easily testable code.

- **DI Container and Services Registration**: Dive into the specifics of the ASP.NET Core DI container. Learn how to register your services and how the container resolves these services to satisfy dependencies in your controllers and other components.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain the key aspects of HTTP that are essential for API development.
- Describe how ASP.NET Core's request/response pipeline works and how to interact with it.
- Understand and implement Dependency Injection in your ASP.NET Core projects.
- Apply the principles of Inverted Dependency and Inversion of Control to improve your application's architecture.
- Use the ASP.NET Core DI container to register and resolve services effectively.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have completed Lesson 1 or have equivalent knowledge of ASP.NET Core Web API basics. A good understanding of C# and familiarity with the .NET framework/ASP.NET Core environment will be beneficial.
