# Lecture 2: Advanced Concepts in ASP.NET Core Web API

In this lecture, we build upon the foundational knowledge from our first session and dive into more advanced concepts critical for developing robust and scalable web APIs using ASP.NET Core in .NET 7/8. We'll explore the intricacies of the HTTP protocol, understand the flow of requests and responses in an ASP.NET Core application, and demystify the concepts of Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).

## Topics Covered

- **Understanding HTTP Fundamentals**: Gain a deeper understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that powers the web. We'll explore how HTTP requests and responses work, the significance of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), and what HTTP status codes represent.

- **Request/Response Pipeline**: Learn about the journey of an HTTP request through the ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline to a response. This section will cover how requests are processed, how responses are formulated, and how middleware can intercept and modify requests and responses.

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Discover the role of Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core, a design pattern that helps in achieving loosely coupled, testable code. We'll discuss the benefits of DI and how it's implemented in ASP.NET Core.

- **Inverted Dependency & Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Understand these foundational principles that support the Dependency Injection pattern. We'll differentiate between Inverted Dependency and Inversion of Control, explaining how they contribute to a more maintainable and flexible application architecture.

- **DI Container and Services Registration**: Dive into the practical aspects of using the built-in Dependency Injection container in ASP.NET Core. Learn how to register your services with the DI container and how ASP.NET Core resolves these services wherever they're needed in your application.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, you will:

- Have a solid understanding of HTTP protocol fundamentals relevant to web API development.
- Be able to describe how the ASP.NET Core request/response pipeline works.
- Understand the concepts of Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and how they facilitate better software design.
- Know how to use the DI container in ASP.NET Core to register and resolve services, enhancing the modularity and testability of your application.

## Prerequisites

This lecture assumes that you have a basic understanding of web development concepts and are familiar with the C# programming language and ASP.NET Core framework. It builds on concepts introduced in the first lecture of this series.
