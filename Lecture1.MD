# Lecture 1: Introduction to ASP.NET Core Web API
Welcome to the first lecture of our ASP.NET Core Web API course! This session is designed to introduce you to the foundational concepts and components necessary for developing modern web APIs with ASP.NET Core in .NET 7/8. Whether you're new to API development or looking to update your skills, this lecture will provide you with a solid starting point.

## Topics Covered

- **What is an API and How It Works**: Understand the basics of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their role in enabling software applications to communicate with each other.

- **Web API Project Structure and Template in .NET 7/8**: Dive into the structure of a Web API project in ASP.NET Core, focusing on the .NET 7/8 framework. We'll explore the default template provided by Visual Studio or the .NET CLI and discuss the purpose of each component.

- **REST Principles**: Learn about Representational State Transfer (REST) and its importance in designing networked applications. We'll cover the principles that guide RESTful services and how they apply to ASP.NET Core Web API development.

- **Demo Controller**: Walk through the creation of a demo controller to see how ASP.NET Core handles HTTP requests and responses. This practical example will help you understand routing, actions, and how to send data back to the client.

- **appsettings.json**: Explore the `appsettings.json` file's role in configuring your ASP.NET Core Web API project. We'll discuss how to use this file to manage application settings and connection strings.

- **Program.cs**: Examine the `Program.cs` file, which serves as the entry point for an ASP.NET Core application. Understand how this file is used to configure the API, set up services, and define middleware.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Describe what APIs are and how they function.
- Identify the key components of an ASP.NET Core Web API project and their roles.
- Understand REST principles and how to implement them in your API design.
- Create a simple controller to handle HTTP requests.
- Configure your Web API project using `appsettings.json`.
- Set up your ASP.NET Core Web API project using `Program.cs`.

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of C# and familiarity with the Visual Studio IDE or the .NET Core CLI. No prior experience with ASP.NET Core or Web API development is required.
